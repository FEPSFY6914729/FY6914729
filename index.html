    This article explores the newly emerging cashierless stores which have been slowly rising in numbers since 2021 ,in the UK, 
    the first being Amazon Fresh located in Ealing,London<a href="#ref-browne-2021">(Browne, 2021)</a>. It identifies the challenges and limitations faced by cashierless stores
    whilst also showcasing the benefits and effectiveness on customer satisfaction. Overall the technology is still being developed and perfected to 
    overcome customer concerns<a href="#ref-amadeo-2024">(Amadeo, 2024)</a>,Experts predict that within the next five years, AI-powered retail will become mainstream across the UK. 
    Tesco plans to expand its GetGo network nationwide, while Sainsbury’s is testing new hybrid models that combine traditional tills with AI-assisted 
    systems.By 2030, over 60% of all supermarket logistics could be automated<a href="#ref-whitmore-2025">(Whitmore, 2025)</a>.Technological advancements in robotics, machine learning, and

 <pre id="Introduction_InText">
    Cashierless stores are no longer just a futuristic idea—they are rapidly becoming a reality<a href="#ref-troc-2025">(TROC Global, 2025)</a>,the goal of them is to allow customers
    to enter the store and exit as quickly and with as little human contact as possible<a href="#ref-gazzola-2022">(Gazzola et al, 2022)</a>. 
    Automation of shops involves the use of advanced technology and tools to handle manual tasks traditionally performed in physical stores,
    on ecommerce platforms, and as part of back-end business operations<a href="#ref-admin-2025">(Admin,2025)</a>, the step-by-step process on how this works is showcased
    in figure 1 below.Concerningly, the UK's retail sector, the country's biggest private employer, keeps losing jobs at a fast rate as companies 
    turn to automation and outsourcing to cut costs. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that 2.81 million jobs were lost in  
    September 2024 due to job automation<a href="#ref-west-2024">(West, 2024)</a>.

<h3 id="Advantages">Advantages of Cashierless Stores</h3>
    <p class = "ex1">
 <pre id="Advantages_InText">
    While there may be some limitations, there are still noteworthy benefits to the rise of cashierless stores. 

    The main advantage of shopping at cashierless stores is the speed and convenience it offers. Without the need to wait in line or interact with a cashier, 
    shoppers can get in and out of the store faster. This is especially beneficial for those in a hurry or looking to grab a few items without the hassle of 
    traditional checkout processes<a href="#ref-taylor-2025">(Taylor, 2025)</a>. 

    Furthermore, cashierless stores provide a more pleasant shopping experience. Without the stress of waiting in line or dealing with slow cashiers,
    customers can focus on finding the products they need. The convenience of simply walking out of the store once you've finished shopping is a significant 
    draw for many people<a href="#ref-taylor-2025">(Taylor, 2025)</a>. 

    Additionally, they capture instore data: every shopping trip generates detailed data about what people buy and how they shop. Retailers gain access 
    to detailed,real-time information about customer behaviour, product popularity, and shopping patterns. Such customer data can be added to the customer’s 
    anonymous profile, enabling the retailer to launch personalised campaigns, engage with the customer after they leave the store, and enhance retention. 
    Retailers can also leverage the data to optimise store layouts,refine product placements, make more informed inventory decisions and conduct predictive
    analysis<a href="#ref-andrea-2024">(Andrea, 2024)</a>.

 <h3 id="AmazonGo">Struggles of cashierless stores: insight from Amazon Fresh</h3> 
<p class = "ex1">
 <pre id="AmazonGoWhyCashierlessRetailStruggled_InText">
    A popular example is the cashierless amazon go store<b>(figure 2)</b>which are open across London; Shoppers can simply 
    grab what they needed, walk out, and have their purchases automatically charged to their accounts - an ambitious 
    vision of the future of shopping<a href="#ref-cashierless-2024">(Cashierless.com, 2024)</a>.  

    For starters, it's expensive to implement, firstly, each store requires a complex network of cameras, 
    sensors,and AI-powered systems to track what customers picked up and automatically charge them. In addition, to the                  
    initial setup costs,which can run into the millions of pounds, there are significant ongoing operational costs               
    <a href="#ref-cashierless-2024">(Cashierless.com, 2024)</a>.Maintaining the infrastructure,constantly retraining AI models, and updating produce catalogues                                               
    proves to be a financial burden<a href="#ref-cashierless-2024">(Cashierless.com, 2024)</a>.

    Secondly, the scalability, While Amazon Go’s technology works well in smaller, more controlled environments, it struggles to scale for larger 
    grocery stores. The system relies heavily on shelf sensors, which require a fixed store layout<a href="#ref-cashierless-2024">(Cashierless.com, 2024)</a>. In an industry where 
    product placements are constantly changing, this creates a significant problem. Even small changes to the layout could throw off the system, 
    leading to errors in inventory tracking and customer charges<a href="#ref-cashierless-2024">(Cashierless.com, 2024)</a>. 

    Thirdly, the resistance from customers, the process of downloading an app and linking payment information is seen as a barrier, especially 
    for one-time visitors. Many shoppers are put off by the idea of using an app to gain entry; additional effort compared to simply walking
    into a traditional store. Privacy concerns also play a significant role, the stores rely heavily on cameras and sensors
    to track every movement, raising questions about data collection and surveillance. Shoppers are wary of being constantly monitored, and with Amazon’s 
    reputation for collecting vast amounts of consumer data, the concept isn't well tolerated<a href="#ref-cashierless-2024">(Cashierless.com, 2024)</a>.

<h3 id="Analysis">Analysis and discussion</h3>
    <p class="ex1">
<pre id="Analysis_InText">
    As retailers use AI and innovative technologies to create a more engaging, personalized, and convenient shopping experience, the future of cashierless
    shopping sounds very promising. However,inferring from figure 3, its evident that there is reluctancy and avoidance due to queries on how exactly 
    customer data is being used and stored. Despite the few challenges that are displayed, most can be efficiently solved with the right implementation
    of systems and processes<a href="#ref-milne-2021">(Milne, 2021)</a>.
    According to <a href="#ref-market-2025">MarketResearch (2025)</a>, as AI and IoT technologies become more sophisticated and cost-effective, we can expect to see an increase in the 
    number and variety of unmanned stores. Innovations such as improved biometric authentication and enhanced AI-driven analytics will further enhance the 
    efficiency and security of these stores.
